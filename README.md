# Portfolio website v2
This is a second version of my portfolio website. The goal was simple - to present my projecs in a most complete and easy accesseble way.
### Software
Project focuses on interaction with the user, so it utilizes a big portion of plain JavaScript. Python is used for back end.
### Functionality
The inteface is designed in a way that user can get short description of the project when selected. Also small demo video starts to play in the right top corner, showing the functionality of the project. At last, website provides a link to the project and possibility to try out the project in window, without leaving the portfolio website.
